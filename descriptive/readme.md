### `1-circadian.R` 

The code for preparing and plotting the circadian pattern in cough. 

### `2-modeling_cough.R`  

The code for modeling the relationship between cough rate mean and cough rate variance among users.  

### `3-minimum_times.R`  

The code for determining the cough rate error associated with various monitoring durations.  

### `4-archetypes.R`  

The code for determining the rate of failure to detect changes in cough rate using 24-hour monitoring, in the case of two users: a chronic cougher receiving antitussive treatment and a smoker attempting to quit.  

### `5-effect_size.R`

The code for simulating the rate of failure to detect changes in cough rate using 24-hour monitoring based on the effect size (i.e., magnitude of the change).  

*Note:* all `R` files contain explanations of the datasets (`.rds` files) they draw upon.
